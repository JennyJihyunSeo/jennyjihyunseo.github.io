👋🏽 Hello, my name is Jihyun (Jenny) Seo. 

🎓 Soon to be grad with a M.S. in Business Analytics at UC Davis (Aug 2025)

🌇 Based in San Francisco, passionate about leveraging data analysis, mathematical modeling, and 7+ years of GTM sales experience to develop sustainable, data-driven business strategies. 

📚 I am an experienced GTM International Sales and Operations Manager with over 7 years of experience in the food manufacturing industry (2017 - 2024), particularly focusing on strategic market expansion and sales operations across Europe, the Middle East, South Africa and India. I've built a track record of hands-on experience in penetrating untapped markets and forging high-impact partnerships. My core expertise includes GTM sales strategy, new product launches, sales operations, supply chain management and compliance with food safety regulations. Currently, I am advancing my analytics skills through M.S. in Business Analytics program at UC Davis to drive data-driven solutions that promote business sustainability and optimize resources in complex environments. 

+  GTM Sales Strategy: Led GTM sales growth initiatives by building strategic partnerships and spearheading negotiations with the top 12 distributors across 9 countries, boosting 46% YoY sales growth and achieving 100.2% of the sales target.
+  GTM New Product Launches: Discovered a strategic product opportunity and launched Jonnga Kimchi Ramen in the UAE, driving $360K in sales by consulting C-level stakeholders and aligning with Carrefour’s business goals and market trends.
+  Supply Chain Optimization: Leveraged Daesang’s international production network to enter the India and Saudi Arabia markets, driving 108% YoY growth in India’s food catering category and generating $58K in new HRM sales in Saudi Arabia.
+  Compliance: Exported dairy products by complying with Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 605/2010, which governs strict import conditions for dairy products by collaborating with Marketing and Quality Control (QC), driving 123% YoY sales growth in the EU dairy category.
+  GTM Sales Operations: Improved the sales order submission process for the China market by conducting data analysis via SAP and collaborating with cross-functional teams, reducing lead time by 33% and increasing logistics capacity by up to 50% across key distribution centers. 

💻 As for my future, I aspire to become a GTM Sales and Operations Specialist, creating data-driven strategies that address business sustainability and industry challenges. I aim to accelerate new sales growth while optimizing costs and profitability, even in resource-constrained environments by blending my previous professional experience with advanced analytics. As part of my M.S. program, I collaborated with Amplytics, a consulting company in San Francisco on a one-year data analytics practicum project. I developed an automated GTM system to identify new sales opportunities (Request for Proposals) in the U.S. utilities sector, that aligned with Amplytics' data analytics skills and services. This project created opportunities for Amplytics to address industry challenges by applying their data analytics skills and services. 

🏔 In my free time, I enjoy running and practicing SNPE (Self Natural Posture Exercise).
I earned a Certificate of Qualification from SNPE Good Posture Academy in 2021, helping individuals manage chronic musculoskeletal pain and promoting personal stress management.

💪 Specialized in analyzing relevant datasets and generating data-driven go-to-market strategies for untapped international markets and industries, creating scalable and impactful data-driven solutions.
