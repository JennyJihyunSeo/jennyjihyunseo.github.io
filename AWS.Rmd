1. **Commands**:
   - `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
   - `cd ..`: Moves back to the parent directory.
   - `ls`: Lists directory contents (`-l` for details, `-a` for hidden files).
2. **File System Structure**:
   - `/home`: User personal files.
   - `/etc`: System configurations.
   - `/var`: Logs and cache data.
   - `/bin`: Executable binaries.
   - `/tmp`: Temporary files.

### File Operations
- **Creating Files**:
  - `touch my-file.txt`: Creates or updates a file.
  - `nano` and `vi`: Text editors to edit files.
- **Editing in `vi`**:
  - `i`: Insert mode.
  - `:wq`: Save and exit.

### AWS CLI and Access Keys

2. `aws s3 ls`: Lists S3 buckets.

### IAM Role and S3 Access
- Assign IAM roles to EC2 instances for S3 access.
- Create S3 buckets and upload files using CLI.

### Linux File Permissions
1. **Permission Format**:
   - Example: `-rw-r--r--`.
   - `r` = Read, `w` = Write, `x` = Execute.
2. **Commands**:
   - `chmod`: Changes file permissions.
   - Symbolic Mode: `chmod g+x` (group execute).
   - Numeric Mode: `chmod 755` (owner all, group/others read/execute).

### File Permission Exercises
- Example Tasks:
  - Make files readable by everyone: `chmod 444`.
  - Allow owner to write: `chmod 644`.
  - Add execute for group: `chmod g+x`.
  - Remove write for group: `chmod g-w`.

# AWS Fundamentals

<br>

<br><br><br>

## AWS Global Infrastructure
- AWS ensures 24/7 availability and scalability globally.
- Components:
  - **Regions**: Independent, geographically isolated networks (e.g., `us-east-1`).
  - **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Isolated data centers providing fault tolerance.
  - **Local Zones**: Low-latency zones for specific user needs.
  - **Edge Locations**: Cache data closer to users via Amazon CloudFront.

## Public vs. Private Subnets
- **Public Subnets**: Accessible via Internet Gateway, ideal for front-end services.
- **Private Subnets**: No direct Internet access, used for back-end services and databases.
- Benefits: Enhanced security, improved performance, and simplified management.

## Amazon VPC
- **VPC**: Logical isolation for AWS resources.
- Key Components:
  - **CIDR Blocks**: Define IP ranges.
  - **Subnets**: Public and private segmentation.
  - **Route Tables**: Direct traffic flows.
  - **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: Enables Internet access for public subnets.
  - **NAT Gateway**: Allows outbound traffic from private subnets.
  - **Security Groups**: Manage inbound/outbound rules (stateful).
  - **NACLs**: Subnet-level stateless traffic controls.

## AWS IAM (Identity Access Management)
- **Users, Groups, Roles**: Define and manage access.
- **Policies**: Define permissions.
- **MFA**: Enhance security via multi-factor authentication.
- **Identity Federation**: Integrates external identity systems.
