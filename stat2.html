<h3>4. Methodology &amp; Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two Sample proportion z-test was used:
<ul>
<li>10,000 random samples of size 500 were drawn for both Ad A and Ad B,
assuming both had a mean CTR of 4.3%, which indicates that those samples
are simulated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true as
the mean of each distribution is the same as each other.</li>
<li>The mean CTR difference was calculated.</li>
<li>If the mean difference exceeded 2.6%, the null hypothesis was
rejected.</li>
<li>Result: p-value = 0.0242 rejecting the null hypothesis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion: At a 0.05 significance level, the p-value of 0.0242
indicates that the null hypothesis (The mean difference between the two
Ads is less than or equal to 2.6%.) can be rejected. The p-value
represents the probability of observing a difference as extreme as, or
more extreme than, 2.6% under the assumption that the null hypothesis is
true. The probability of observing this extreme value (the mean
difference between the two Ads greater than 2.6%) is 2.4%. Since the
p-value is less than the significance level, we have sufficient evidence
to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that Ad B is statistically
significantly 2.6% more effective than Ad A.</li>

<h3>2. Goal</h3>
<ul>
<li>To demonstrate how the sample mean evolves as the sample size
increases, and how the population variance affects the variability of
sample means.
<ul>
<li>The sample mean becomes closer to the true population mean as the
sample size increases.</li>
<li>The stability of sample means improves when sampling from
populations with lower variance.</li>

<h3>3. Methodology</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Setup:
<ul>
<li>Two populations are sampled, both with a mean of 70 but with
different variances.
<ul>
<li>Population 1: Variance = 36 (Standard Deviation = 6)</li>
<li>Population 2: Variance = 9 (Standard Deviation = 3)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sample sizes range from 1 to 100.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Process:
<ul>
<li>Random samples are drawn from each population for each sample size
(1 to 100).</li>
<li>The sample means are calculated and stored for both
populations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Process:
<ul>
<li>The sample means are plotted against sample sizes to observe
trends.</li>
<li>Red Line: Population with larger variance (36)</li>
<li>Blue Line: Population with smaller variance (9)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion:
<ul>
<li>When the population variance is larger and sampling from this
population, the sample means vary largely when the sample size is
smaller. This variance is getting smaller when the sample size
increases. In contrast, if the population variance is smaller and random
samples from this population, there is less variability in the sample
means compared to the first random sampling from the population with
larger variance. The sample mean of the second population gets closer to
the population mean which is 70 rapidly while showing greater stability
even when the sample size is small.</li>

<h3>1. Definition</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Multi-Armed Bandit approach tests multiple levers (e.g.,
advertisements) to identify the best lever offering the highest
compensation. In this case:
<ul>
<li>4 advertisements are tested to determine the one with the highest
CTR (Click-Through Rate).</li>
<li>Fisher’s exact test is used instead of the proportion test when
sample sizes (exposures of advertisements) are low.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="goal-3" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Goal</h3>
<p>To identify the advertisement with the highest CTR and evaluate
whether any other advertisements can serve as suitable alternatives.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="methodology-1" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Methodology</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Setup:
<ul>
<li>Four advertisements (Ad1, Ad2, Ad3, Ad4) are initialized with
baseline CTRs:
<ul>
<li>Ad1: 2.5%, Ad2: 1%, Ad3: 0.5%, Ad4: 1.5%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The best advertisement starts with the highest baseline CTR.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dynamic Sampling:
<ul>
<li>Advertisements are exposed probabilistically, with higher
probabilities assigned to the current best-performing ad.</li>
<li>A random click (1 for success, 0 for failure) is generated based on
the CTR of the selected ad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Updating Beliefs:
<ul>
<li>Clicks and exposures are updated after each trial.</li>
<li>CTR for each advertisement is recalculated:
<ul>
<li><strong>CTR</strong> (Click-Through Rate):</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{CTR} = \frac{\text{Clicks}}{\text{Exposures}}
\]</span> + CTR represents the ratio of the number of clicks to the
number of times an advertisement was shown (exposures).</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Testing Significance:
<ul>
<li>Once all advertisements have at least 10 exposures, Fisher’s test is
applied:</li>
<li><strong>Null Hypothesis (<span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>):</strong></li>
</ul>
<span class="math display">\[
H_0: \text{CTR}_{\text{Best}} \geq \text{CTR}_{\text{Alternative}}
\]</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (<span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>):</strong></li>
</ul>
<span class="math display">\[
H_1: \text{CTR}_{\text{Best}} &lt; \text{CTR}_{\text{Alternative}}
\]</span>
<ul>
<li>Advertisements with p-values &lt; 0.05 are removed due to
significant differences from the best ad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion:
<ul>
<li>The process continues until only the best advertisement and its
close alternatives (if any) remain.</li>
<li>The first advertisement has the highest CTR and there are no
suitable alternatives with similar CTR compared to the best choice.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Interpretation: (1) Letter - Control: There is a statistically
significant difference in basket score between Letter Nutrition Labels
and no labels. If there are letter nutrition labels, it encourages
customers to buy healthier groceries while increasing the basket scores
by 3.18 units compared to the control group. (2) Star - Control: There
is a statistically significant difference in basket score between Star
Nutrition Labels and no labels (control). When Star Nutrition Labels are
displayed, they encourage customers to buy healthier groceries,
increasing the basket score by 2.18 units compared to the control group.
(3) Warn - Control: There is a statistically significant difference in
basket score between Warn Nutrition Labels and no labels. Warning Labels
have the strongest effect, leading to a increase of 5.38 units in basket
scores compared to the control group. (4) Warn - Letter: When comparing
Warning Nutrition Labels and Letter Nutrition Labels, there is a
statistically significant difference in basket scores. Warning Labels
are more effective, increasing basket scores by 2.18 units compared to
Letter Nutrition Labels. (5) Warn - Star: When comparing Warning
Nutrition Labels and Star Nutrition Labels, there is a statistically
significant difference in basket scores. Warning Labels are more
effective, increasing basket scores by 3.19 units compared to Star

<p>At a 0.05 significance level, the overall model is statistically
significant but R-squared is low. Only 2.3% of the variation in the
dependent variable is explained by independent variables. In terms of
coefficients of the independent variables, all coefficients are
statistically significant at 0.05 significance level. The baseline
Basket Score for the control group is 55.27 units, meaning that the
average basket scores without labels is 55.27 units. In case of Warning
Nutrition Labels, if there is one unit increase in the use of Warning
Nutrition Labels, basket scores increase by 5.37 units on average.</p>

coefficient slope making the linearly decreasing regression model, when
making Price variable as a categorical variable, the coefficient
variables vary depending on different price factors, indicating the

<p>Among the models, treating Price as a categorical variable yielded
the best fit (highest Adjusted R-squared). However, for prediction

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: In the first regression model, it
represents the treatment effect for each income group. The first
regression shows different income levels affect the amount of deposits
without any treatment effect. However, the most important thing to
discuss is that it represents the treatment effect for each income
group. Therefore, this regression model shows the treatment effect for
each income level comparing with the control group for each income
group. In contrast, the second regression model shows the baseline
treatment effect of the income group 2 ($50-100K) which allows us to
compare the treatment effect among different income levels. First, the
income group 2 received the treatment effect increases deposit amounts
by 587.95 units on average when comparing the income group 2 within the
control group. The income group 1 received the treatment effect saved
41.52 units less than the income group 2 received the treatment effect.
However, this estimate is not statistically significant, meaning that
this difference is not a meaningful difference but just random
variation. However, the income group 3 in the treatment effect saved
437.46 units less than the income 2 group under the treatment effect and
this estimate is statistically significant,concluding that the treatment
effect differs between these groups.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Here in this regression model, Age
and income are covariates to estimate CATEs (Conditional Average
Treatment effects) which can estimate an individual’s heterogeneous
treatment effect. Age is a categorical variable with two different
value, one of which is younger than 35 (&lt;35) and the other one is
older than or equal to 35 (&gt;=35). Intercept 803.44 units represents
people’s average saving amounts in the control group under 35 (&lt;35)
within the income group 2 ($50-100K). The treatment group effect is
352.64 units, indicating that people received treatment effect who are
younger than 35 within the income group 2 saved more deposits (treatment
effect) on average compared to the control group. We can answer the
following questions by combining the effects of covariates such as age
and income and their corresponding interaction terms with the treatment
group and calculate CATE (Conditional Average Treatment Effect).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What would the treatment effect be for some of age 30 with income of

with the same age and within the same income group , which is people
younger than 30 within the income group 1 in the control group, which is
803.44 - 206.15 = 597.29 units. In conclusion, the treatment effect is
558.30 units.</li>
<li>What would the treatment effect be for some of age 30 with income of

is 803.44. In conclusion, the treatment effect is 1129.08 units.</li>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: In this regression model, covariates
such as income and age are both treated an continuous. In case of the
intercept, it represents people in the control group when their age and
income are both zero saved -1026 units on average but it is not
realistic because in the real world, age and income cannot be zero. When
people in the control group with their age and income being zero are
treated, their savings increases by 367 units on average. When income
increases by 1 unit in the control group, the savings increases by
0.007807 units on average. Similarly, if age increases by 1 unit, the
savings increases by 48.47 units on average. When income increases by 1
unit , the treatment effect decreases by 0.004383 units on average
whereas when age increases by 1 unit, the treatment effect increases by
8.963 units on average.</p>

<h4>(1) Why do we randomly assign people to a treatment and control
group in an experiment?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: If we want to compare two groups to
determine any treatment effect on the dependent variable Y, we have to
control other factors (confounders) except for the treatment effect to
make the two groups identical. For example, if we want to experiment
whether a specific treatment effect is effective by identifying any
difference on the dependent variable, we have to control other factors
and impose the treatment on a treatment group and compare the dependent
variable of Y for each group to determine whether this treatment effect
makes any difference on Y.</li>

<h4>(2) What is external validity, and why can it be low for lab
experiments in a business setting?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: External validity is the extent to
which any findings in experiments can be extrapolated to other settings
outside a laboratory. However, lab experiments in a business setting
have low external validity as real-world environments are useful to
observe real customers’ behaviors which affected by diverse factors that
cannot be identically reflected in the lab experiments. Therefore,
results from the lab experiments cannot be extrapolated into real
scenarios accurately. In contrast, lab experiments in medical settings
can be more extrapolated well in other settings outside the laboratory
as medication effects are mostly related to biological mechanism in
body, which is almost similar to human beings.</li>

<h4>(3) Why do field experiments tend to have higher external validity
than laboratory experiments in a business setting?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: In a laboratory experiment, the
primary limitation is that the experiment cannot perfectly reflect a
real-scenario in which customers behave, which prevents external
validity because there is high possibility that customers behave
differently in the real-scenario. For example, in the laboratory
experiment, customers prefer to purchase products with lower prices
compared to field experiments where customers prefer to purchase
high-quality products with higher prices. In a field experiment, we can
monitor how customers behave in a real environment which would be
maintained when applying learnings from this experiment and this
identical environment can lead to similar results we have already
obtained in the experiment.</li>

<h4>(4) When it comes to measuring important quantities like price
elasticity, research has compared how field experiments perform relative
to using statistical models on observational (non-experimental) data.
What has the research found, and what likely explain this finding?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: When examining price elasticity in a
field experiment, researcher can control other factors except for price
to see the true relationship between price and demand. The researcher
controls the quality of products, which could affect demand and set
different prices in different locations to identify the price effect on
the demand. However, in case of an observational data, researchers use
the dataset already gathered in which other factors (confounders),
affecting the price cannot be controlled. However, price effect can be
endogenous, meaning that other factors such as quality can affect the
price and demand, which prevents researchers from identifying the true
price effect on the demand. For example, even if the real effect of the
price on the demand is that higher price leads to lower demand, the
quality of product typically increase prices, which also makes the
demand higher. However, the observational data cannot remove this
confounding factor, which confounds the true price effect on the
demand.</li>

<h4>(5) In the context of an experiment, explain what is the p-value

<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: p-value is the probability of
observing extreme values which are not likely to be observed when
assuming the null hypothesis is true. Observing the extreme values
indicates that there are chances that the null hypothesis is false. For
example, in a one-tailed greater test, Let’s assume that the null
hypothesis is that the sample mean is less than or equal to 5 while the
alternative hypothesis is the sample mean is greater than 5. If the
p-value for observing an extreme value greater than 5 is 0.05 which is
less than 0.05 significance level, the probability of observing this
extreme value is too small not to reject the null hypothesis.</li>

<h4>(6) Sometimes people confuse significance level α with the
likelihood that a discovery is false. Explain the distinction between
the two.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: - The significance level of α is the
probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
In other words, the significance level of α is the probability of
committing the type 1 error. When p-value which is the probability of
observing extreme values when assuming that the null hypothesis is true
is less than the significance level of α, the null hypothesis can be
rejected.</li>
<li>In case of the significance level of α, it assumes when the null
hypothesis is actually true and it indicates that probability that we
falsely conclude that a sample statistic is statistically significant.
However, a false discovery in a past experiment is the case that we
already concluded that a sample statistic is statistically significant
by comparing a p-value with a specific significance level but after
that, we found that the null hypothesis is true and there is not true
effect. The false discovery rate is typically much higher than the
significance level of α as there are diverse variables which led to a
false discovery in experiments such as repetitive experiments increase
the chances of obtaining the number of significant results by chance and
statistical power of the experiment being lower at that moment.</li>

<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: While Incremental conversion rate
considers both treatment group and control group (baseline), Click
through rate (CTR) also includes the number of people clicking a banner
without being influenced by the treatment, making it hard to distinguish
with the true effect of the treatment. The incremental conversion rate
compares the treatment effect with the baseline effect of the control
group, making it effective to evaluate the true treatment effect. If the

<h4>(11) We have run an experiment online showing an ad, hoping to
increase our sales. The ad was shown to 500 people, and another 400
people were tracked as a control group. 10% of the treatment group and
8% of the control group purchased our product. The treatment group
generated $60 in profit (not including cost of the ad), while the
control group generated $45 in profit. The ad cost was $0.01 each we
show it. Our ROI benchmark is 30%; should we continue to show this ad?
Explain why? The equations below may be helpful.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: 500 people were included in the
treatment group and 400 people were included in the control group. 50
customers purchased products after having seen the advertisement. In
contrast, 32 customers purchased products without seeing any
advertisement. The incremental conversion rate is 2% by deducting 8%
from 10%. $60 is a profit obtained by the treatment group after
deducting operational expenses other than the cost of the advertisement
and $45 is a profit obtained by the control group after subtracting
operational expenses other than the cost of the advertisement. The
advertisement cost is $0.01 * 500 = $5 and our ROI benchmark is 30%,
which means to continue the advertisement, the ROI should be at least
over 30%.</li>
<li>First of all, Cost per Increment Conversion (CPIC) is $5 / (2% *
500) = $0.5. Increment conversion means additional conversion amount due
to the true effect of the advertisement itself, which is the difference
between the treatment group and the control group. The cost is assigned
for the true incremental conversion amount compared to the control
group.</li>
<li>Secondly, profit for increment conversion is $60 / (500 * 10%) =
$1.2. However, this is the profit for conversions in the treatment
effect and not the profit for additional incremental conversion compared
to the control group. In less conservative way, the profit for
conversions in the control group can be added, and the total profit is
$60 + $45 / (500<em>10%) + (400</em>8%) = $1.28.</li>
<li>In more conservative way, ROI = (1.2 – 0.5) / 0.5 * 100 = 140% weigh
over the benchmark. In conclusion, this outcome leads to a data-driven
decision making to continue the advertisement.</li>

<h4>(1) Explain What ANOVA tests.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: When comparing multiple group means,
ANOVA test is used to determine whether all means among multiple groups
are the same as each other or at least two means differ. In one-way
ANOVA, there should be multiple k treatments and the null hypothesis is
all treatment means are the same, indicating that there are no

<h4>(2) After running ANOVA, we may run a Tukey Multiple Comparisons
test. What does this test tell us?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: The ANOVA test is an omni-test,
meaning that we can identify at least two means differ after rejecting
the null hypothesis, while we cannot identify which treatments differ
from each other. The Tukey Multiple Comparisons test helps identify
which treatment group differs from any of other treatment groups.</li>

class="section level4">
<h4>(3) After running ANOVA, we may run a Tukey Multiple Comparisons
test. What does this test tell us?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: There are 3 major Post hoc tests to
identify which treatment groups differ among others, such as Fisher’s
Least Significant Difference (LSD), Bonferroni correction, and Tukey’s
multiple comparisons. In case of Fisher’s LSD, it inflates the
probability of committing at least one type 1 error when comparing
multiple pairwise comparisons. If the number of pairwise comparisons
increases, the probability of committing at least one type 1 error also
increases because the Fisher’s LSD applied 0.05 significance level for
each pairwise comparison.</li>
<li>To address this inflation, Bonferroni is used by dividing the
significance level for each pairwise comparison by the number of
comparisons to prevent the inflation of the probability of at least one
type 1 error. However, it increases the probability of type 2 error due
to the lower significance level α. P-value must be lower than the
extremely lower significance level, which increases the type 2 error by
missing the true effect.</li>
<li>In case of a Tukey’s multiple comparison, it uses family-wise error
rate which is the same as significance level of α. It controls the
probability of committing at least one type 1 error across all multiple
comparisons in the test as around significance level of 0.05 to reduce
the inflation of type 1 error by adjusting p-values. When p-value
adjusted, it reflects that the observed values are less extreme under
the null hypothesis, reducing the likelihood of falsely rejecting the
null hypothesis. This adjustment helps to maintain the integrity of the
test by preventing the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is
actually true, thereby controlling for Type 1 error across multiple
comparisons.</li>

class="section level4">
<h4>(5) Broadly speaking, when would we run planned comparison tests
instead of a Tukey Multiple Comparison test? And what would be the
downside of running the Tukey Multiple Comparison instead?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: The Tukey Multiple Comparison test
compares all possible comparisons which inflates the probability of
committing at least one type 1 error. However, the planned comparison
test only compares some comparisons interested in, reducing the
probability of at least one type 1 error. Matching our tests to our
hypotheses, rather than testing all possible combinations of conditions,
reduces the risk of Type 1 error; running a Tukey test instead would
have a higher likelihood of Type1 error, simply because we are running
more tests, and would necessitate more aggressively adjusting our
p-values. Consequently, the p-values of the tests actually appropriate
for our hypotheses would be higher than they should be if we use a Tukey
test.</li>

<h4>(8) When modeling treatment doses in a regression, we have the
option of taking a parametric or non-parametric approach. Explain the
pros and cons of choosing a parametric approach over a non-parametric
approach (or vice-versa).</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: A non-parametric approach represents
the relationship between X and Y variables without exact mathematical
equations. If we want to determine the price elasticity and identify the
relationship between price and demand, non-parametric describes
relationships based on observed data without using mathematical
equations. However, a parametric approach uses a specific mathematical
equation such as linear or polynomial and predicts the dependent
variable Y with independent variables. This parametric approach lies
strengths in predicting Y values outside the range of X values, which is
known as extrapolation. This strength depends on the accuracy of the
chosen model and its underlying assumptions. In contrast, non-parametric
approach cannot reliably predict the Y value outside the range of the X
values as it does not generalize beyond the available data.
Additionally, non-parametric test can have an over-fitting issue while
making random noise as meaningful. In case of parametric test, it may
result in error if the chosen model does not accurately represent the
data.</li>

<h4>(1) In simple terms, explain endogeneity.</h4>

<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Endogeneity occurs when the
independent variables are correlated with the error term. To prevent a
coefficient bias, the independent variables are independent from the
error term. However, omitted variables included in the error term are
correlated with independent variables which lead to coefficient bias,
making it hard to distinguish the true effect between the dependent and

relationship between educational level and income, we have to control
personal characteristics such as motivation and personal ability as they
are correlated with educational level, leading to the coefficient bias.
People with good personal ability often has higher educational level and
this variable also influence the dependent variable, making it hard to

<h4>(3) What features of panel data allow us to conduct a
difference-in-differences analysis?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: A panel data has multiple observations
for multiple units across time. If some units are treated during a
specific period, the other units without treatment can be used to
identify the true treatment effect during the same period by acting as
counterfactual. For example, if there is treatment effect occurred from
July during one year for some units and parallel trends assumption is
not violated before the treatment effect, we can identify the treatment
effect by comparing the value for the treated units from July to
December to the value for the untreated units during the same period.
These untreated units during the same period (Jul – Dec) works as a
counterfactual for the treated units. We cannot simply compare the
dependent variable from Jan to Jun to the value from Jul to Dec to
acquire the treatment effect. We should assume what would have happened
if the treated units had not been treated by using the other units as
counterfactual and compare them during the same treatment period (Jul –

<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Endogeneity is related to omitted

<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: A synthetic control group constructed
group combining units matched with the treatment group of interest based
on observable confounding variables and the change trends on the
dependent variable Y prior to the treatment period. We can use weights
to make the control group comparable with the treatment group to control
for the effects of observable confounding variables while simultaneously
considering the trends of the dependent variables matched with the one
shown on the treatment group during the control period. This method
considers both matching the observable variables and the dependent

<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Instrument variables are tools used to
address endogeneity in regression analysis. Endogeneity occurs when the
independent variable is correlated with the error term. Independent
variables are correlated with error terms due to omitted confounding
variables which influence both the independent variable and the
dependent variable. These confounding variables make it hard to
distinguish the true causal relationship between the independent

are not correlated with error term and does not affect the dependent

<h4>(8) Describe the two-stage least squares procedure in terms of
regression models and the variables X, Y, and Z, and explain what the
approach accomplishes?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: First, to isolate exogenous variation
in X using Z, the 2SLS model regresses X on Z. For example, if the
independent variable is educational level and the dependent variable Y
is income, instrumental variable can be the distance between the school
and students’ housing. The distance can affect people’s educational
level and the first step of regression isolates the variation in the
independent variable, educational level, that is explained by the
instrumental variable, distance.</li>
<li>Second, if this effect can be denoted by X ̂, the dependent variable
Y is regressed on this exogeneous variation. The 2SLS is free from the
effects of confounding variables which can affect both the independent
variable and dependent variable, making it hard to distinguish the true
educational effect on the income level. This model only isolates the
variation in the independent variable X occurred by the instrument
variable and regresses the dependent variable Y on the exogenous effect
reflected on those variation to identify the true causal
relationship.</li>

<h4>(3) What are the benefits of surge pricing to the riders who must
pay higher prices?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: If prices go up, in case of
car-sharing services, the riders can easily catch rides even if they
must pay higher prices as drivers are motivated to supply drives for the
riders during the surge pricing time.</li>

<h4>(4) Why is dynamic pricing likely to lead to price
discrimination?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Offering discounts during certain
period to attract more customers is a dynamic pricing, which can lead to
price discrimination as customers purchase a product during discount
seasons pay less compared to customers purchasing the same product
during normal seasons, related to price discrimination for the same
product or services.</li>

class="section level4">
<h4>(5) Why do temporary discounts lead to what is commonly referred to
as the “post-promotion dip”?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: During a temporary promotion season,
customers are attracted to purchase more units of a product compare to
the actual amount they need for stockpiling. After the promotion,
post-promotion dip happens as customers already purchased more units of
the product as needed, leading to the reduction in the sales.</li>

<h4>(6) What are the pros and cons of temporary discounts?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: The pros of temporary discounts
attract customers who would not have purchased any products at full
price by motivating them to purchase the product with more reasonable
price. The cons of the temporary discounts offer discounts to customers
who would have purchased the product without any discount, meaning that
a company offering this discount offers unnecessary discounts for
customers who did not need any discount for purchasing the product.</li>

<h4>(7) We want to model the impact of stockpiling on our unit sales of
toilet paper. Stockpiling typically occurs when there are price
discounts, and the impact on sales lasts from some period of time. As a
result, we collect data on prices and sales at our store and create the
regression equation below. Interpret the coefficients. Would you
anticipate the coefficients of γ would be positive or negative, and
why?</h4>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Sales}_t = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{Price}_t + \gamma_1 \cdot

\text{Price}_{t-3} + \gamma_4 \cdot \text{Price}_{t-4}
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: α measures the sales when all prices
are zero. β measures the sales of the current week or today. All γ
measure the impact of discounts during 4 weeks on the sales for this
week. If there are discounts on the units of toilet paper prior to this
week, the sales during this week or today is likely to decrease due to
stockpiling during the promotions. The coefficients of γ would be
positive because if the prices during the promotion weeks drop, the
sales for this week are likely to drop, moving the same direction with
the coefficients of γ.</li>

that stockpiling hurts sales for three weeks and then sales return to

significance (whether it would be significant or not) of each γ
coefficient would be.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: If stockpiling due to promotions hurts
sales for three weeks, γ for three weeks prior to this week would be
positive and statistically significant whereas γ for 4 weeks prior to
this week would not be significant as stockpiling hurts sales for this
week only for three weeks.</li>

<h3>7. Recommendation Systems</h3>

<h4>(1) I claim that recommendation systems like the collaborative
filter help us account for unobservable heterogeneous preferences. What
do I mean by that?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Unobservable heterogeneous preferences
cannot accurately be analyzed but the collaborative filter helps
recommend suitable products or services for users by referencing other
users’ choices with similar characteristics. We cannot accurately know
heterogeneous preferences for the target user but can assume other users
with similar characteristics with the target user provides sufficient
hints for the target user’s preferences and recommend products or
services for the target user that were recommended for other similar
users with similar preferences.</li>

class="section level4">
<h4>(2) Explain at least two benefits of recommendation systems to
customers that we discussed in class.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: First, the recommendation systems to
customers can reduce search engine cost as customers do not need to
search every option to find what they exactly need, which can make them
overwhelmed with too many options. It also reduces time that customers
have to input to find proper items, making the entire process more
efficient. Second, the first benefit is actually related to this second
benefit which increases customers’ satisfaction. The collaborative
filter can remind users of things that they might want to purchase again
or effectively find products that align with customers’ preferences,
leading to the increase in their satisfaction after using them. Third,
the recommendation systems allow businesses particularly for online
retailers to increase product offerings while increasing larger
inventories as it helps offer the subset of products for users based on
their preferences, requiring niche products to satisfy more broadened
range of customers. For example, Costco often reduces inventories by
offering only products which can meet the preferences for average
customers whereas this recommendation systems allow online retailers to
increase the inventories for niche products which can attract more
diverse customers and broaden their customer segmentation.</li>

<h4>(3) How do recommendation systems make larger inventories more
plausible for online retailers?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: The recommendation systems allow
businesses particularly for online retailers to increase product

subset of products for users based on their preferences, requiring niche
products to satisfy more broadened range of customers. For example,

class="section level4">
<h4>(4) What is the key trade-off the collaborative filter makes versus
more sophisticated models?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: The collaborative filter trade-off the
accuracy in exchange for the speed. The accuracy is higher in
sophisticated models than the collaborative filter whereas the
collaborative filter achieves higher speed which is necessary sometimes
for online retailers to motivate customers to purchase recommended
products.</li>

class="section level4">
<h4>(5) A major limitation of the collaborative filter is that it
implicitly treats a product not purchased by a customer as unknown to
them, and something to potentially be recommended. Why might this
implicit assumption be wrong?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: The implicit assumption is the
collaborative filter implicitly treats products not purchased by
customers as being unaware to them and something invaluable to be
recommended. However, in reality, customers often know their preferences
on whether to dislike a product before deciding to purchase it. If any
product with lower demand and not purchased by customers, it would mean
that customers dislike the product and decide not to purchase it.</li>

<div id="what-is-algorithmic-bias" class="section level4">
<h4>(6) What is algorithmic bias?</h4>

religion, and other socioeconomic status.</li>

</div>
<div
id="one-way-algorithmic-bias-can-happen-is-if-human-inputs-are-used-to-train-the-model.-explain-how-algorithmic-bias-might-occur-in-this-case."
class="section level4">
<h4>(7) One-way algorithmic bias can happen is if human inputs are used
to train the model. Explain how algorithmic bias might occur in this
case.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: If any model is trained by human
inputs, it is likely to learn about human behaviors or thought towards
protected lines, such as gender, age, disability, race and other
socioeconomic factors. For example, if the model is trained by
user-generated texts and images in SNSs like Instagram, Facebook and
Twitter where users’ biased opinions towards protected lines were
already reflected, there is high possibility that this model is biased
towards the same lines.</li>

<h4>(8) Algorithmic bias occurs even if the algorithm does not
explicitly model protected dimensions like gender. In machine learning
models where a large number of variables are used to predict an outcome
(e.g., mortgage default), how might this happen?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Even if the algorithm does not
explicitly include any protected dimensions as model variables such as
gender, age, disability and other socioeconomic factors, algorithmic
bias occurs, for example certain racial groups have shown high default
rate from historical data due to some systematic disparities, for
certain racial groups even if the model does not include race as one of
the model variables. If included variables are correlated with this
unexplicit variable such as race, the model can be biased,
disadvantaging certain racial group.</li>
